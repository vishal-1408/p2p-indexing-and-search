## Exercises

Let's get started with building with Hyperbee.
For this you should make a new file, and setup a Corestore.

<details>
  <summary>If you are just starting here you can use our boilerplate:</summary>

```js

const Corestore = require('corestore')

start()

async function start () {
  const store = new Corestore('my-storage-1')
  const core = store.get({ name: 'hyperbee-exercise' })
}
```
</details>

Make sure you install Hyperbee from npm as well.

```sh
npm install hyperbee
```

#### Exercise 1

Make a Hyperbee instance and use the [`await db.put(key, value)` API](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperbee#await-dbputkey-value) to insert the following key/value pairs into the db.

```js
{ key: 'foo', value: 'foo-value' }
{ key: 'bar', value: 'bar-value' }
{ key: 'baz', value: 'baz-value' }
```

To instantiate the database you use the following snippet:

```js
// Important! Make sure you don't use a valueEncoding on the core itself.
const core = store.get({ name: 'hyperbee-exercise' })

// Then make a new Hyperbee on top of the core that stores string encoded keys and values.
const db = new Hyperbee(core, { keyEncoding: 'utf-8', valueEncoding: 'utf-8' })
```

To verify that you inserted the values try reading them out using [`const { value } = await db.get(key)` API](https://github.com/mafintosh/hyperbee#-seq-key-value---await-dbgetkey).

## Stuck?

Take a look at the [solution here](/solutions/01/index.js).

## Takeaways

* You can see the full Hyperbee API in [the Hyperbee README](https://github.com/holepunchto/hyperbee#API)
* You can read more about the building blocks in the [Holepunch documentation](https://docs.holepunch.to/)
* Try playing around with inserting more key/values. Notice how the length of the Hypercore increases by 1 everytime we insert a new pair?
* The embedded index used by Hyperbee means that you don't have to download the entire log to find a key. It only needs to download O(n) entries to find any key.
